# Code Walkthroughs

Welcome to the Code Walkthrough section! 

Here is where you will find walkthroughs of some of my projects, assignments or small scripts. I will aim to explain what each line of code is doing, and the thought process behind implementing each line. 

The programming languages I am currently learning and are most likely to be featured in this section are Python, C, Powershell and Bash.
